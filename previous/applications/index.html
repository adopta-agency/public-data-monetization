<p><strong>APIs Open Up Many Potential Applications That Support the Mission</strong><br />As doing business on the web became commonplace in the early 21st century, Amazon was realizing that they could enable the sales of their books and other products on the websites of their affiliate partners by using APIs. In 2016 there are many additional applications being developed on top of APIs, with delivering public data to multiple websites just the beginning.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Web</strong> - It is common for websites to pull from a database. Increasingly APIs are being used to drive not just a single website, but networks, and distributed websites that draw data and content from a variety of sources.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile</strong> - APIs are used to make data and content available across a variety of mobile applications, on different platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Embeddable</strong> - Delivering data to buttons, badges, bookmarklets, and widgets that can be embedded across a variety of websites, and applications.</li>
<li><strong>Conversational</strong> - Using data in conversational interfaces like for bots, messaging, and voice-enabled applications.</li>
<li><strong>Visualizations</strong> - Including data in visualizations, showing API consumption, and platform usage around public data.</li>
<li><strong>iPaaS / ETL -</strong> Enabling the migration of public data to and from other external 3rd party platforms using traditional ETL, or more modern iPaaS solutions powered via the API.</li>
<li><strong>Webhooks</strong> - Notifying external systems of relevant events (location or service update) by pushing to URLs via what is called a webhook.</li>
<li><strong>Spreadsheets -</strong> Publishing of data to Microsoft Excel or Google Spreadsheet using the public data APIs, as well as spreadsheet APIs.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a sample of the number of ways in which a single, or multiple APIs can be used to deliver public data to many different endpoints, all in service of a single mission. When you consider this in support of public services, and specifically food services, a bigger picture of how APIs and public data can be used to better serve the population--all it takes is a for a standardized, well-planned set of APIs to be made available.</p>
