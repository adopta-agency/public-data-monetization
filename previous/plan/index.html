p><strong>Putting Together A Monetization Plan Involving Public Data</strong><br />With an understanding of the hard costs of providing a public data platform and an awareness of the intended value to be generated via operations, we can now look at what details would be involved in a plan for executing this monetization strategy. API management frameworks are engineered for metering, measuring, and limiting access in service of a coherent, transparent public data monetization strategy. </p>
<p>Here is a core framework of API management that can be applied to public data that can be used to drive monetization efforts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Access</strong> - What are the default access levels for public data access via the API.
<ul>
<li><strong>Self-Service -</strong> Public access to the platform via user registration, or 3rd party authentication like Twitter, Facebook, or Github.</li>
<li><strong>Approval</strong> - Access level(s) that require the approval of user or application before they are able to access platform resources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Tiers -</strong> What are the multiple tiers of access for all data resources available via API.
<ul>
<li><strong>Public</strong> - Define the default public access for the platform, with a free, limited access tier that is obtainable via a self-service registration without approval.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Contributor </strong>- Providing a tier of access to contribute content, validate and management data on the platform.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Service Provider </strong>- Providing a tier of access for service providers involved with public data operations.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Internal</strong> - Access tier for internal groups, used by all websites, mobile applications, and system integrations.</li>
<li><strong>Partner</strong> - Tier(s) of access design for data, and other partners involved in management of public data resources.</li>
<li><strong>Commercial</strong> - Access tier(s) for commercial usage of public data resources with higher levels of access for set fees.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Commercial</strong> - Access tier(s) for non-commercial usage of public data resources with specific access waving fees.</li>
<li><strong>Government</strong> - A set of API resources is available specifically for government access.</li>
<li><strong>Auditor</strong> - Access across APIs specifically designed for external 3rd party auditors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Elements</strong> - What are the core elements that make up the service composition for the monetization plan(s).
<ul>
<li><strong>Paths</strong> - Establishing plans based upon the availability and access to different API endpoints, <span>including platform meta API</span>. </li>
<li><strong>Read / Write - </strong>Restricting read and write access to public data to specific tiers, limiting who writes data to only trusted applications.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Time Frames </strong>- What are the timeframes that impacts the public data / API monetization plan(s) and consumption.
<ul>
<li><strong>Daily</strong> - What are the details for managing, guiding, and restricting plan entries each day.</li>
<li><strong>Weekly</strong> - What are the details for managing, guiding, and restricting plan entries in weekly timeframes.</li>
<li><strong>Monthly</strong> - What are the details for managing, guiding, and restricting plan entries on a monthly basis.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Metrics</strong> - What is being measured to quantify value generated, providing a framework to understand monetization possibilities.
<ul>
<li><strong>API Calls - </strong>Each call to the API is measured, providing the cornerstone of monetizing access and contribution to public data--remember not all calls will cost, some will add value with contributions.</li>
<li><strong>URL Clicks -</strong> Each click on a URL served up via the API drive data and content is measured, providing details on value delivered to internal and external websites--URL shortener required for this.</li>
<li><strong>Searches - </strong>All searches conducted via the API are measured, providing details on what users are looking for.</li>
<li><strong>Users -</strong> Measure user acquisitions and history to keep track of the value of each platform user.</li>
<li><strong>Applications -</strong> Measure the number of applications added, with details of activity to understand value generated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Limits</strong> - What are the limitations imposed across all tiers of access as part of the API monetization plan.
<ul>
<li><strong>API Calls -</strong> How many API calls any single application can make during a specific time frame.</li>
<li><strong>IP Address -</strong> Which IP addresses you can request data from, limiting scope of serving data.</li>
<li><strong>Spend - </strong>How much any user can spend during a given time period, for each user or application.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Pricing</strong> - What prices are set for different aspects of the monetizing the platform.
<ul>
<li><strong>Tiers</strong> - What are the base prices established for each tier of API access.</li>
<li><strong>Unit</strong> - What are the default unit prices of per API call access for each tier.</li>
<li><strong>Support</strong> - What charges are in place for receiving support for platform applications.</li>
<li><strong>SLA</strong> - What costs are associated with delivering specific quality or levels of service and availability?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the moving parts of a public data monetization strategy. It allows any public data resources to be made available on the web, enabling self-service access to data 24/7. However, it does it in a way that requires accountability by ALL consumers, whether they are internal, partner, or the public at large. This API management scaffolding allows for the frictionless access to public data resources by the users and applications that are identified as worthwhile, and imposing limits, and fees for higher volume and commercial levels of access. </p>
