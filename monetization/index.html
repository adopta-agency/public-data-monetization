title: Monetization

<p><strong>The Monetization Requirements Around Public Data API Operations</strong><br />This is where we get to the portion of this exercise that is specifically about monetization of the operations around publishing and maintaining high-quality sources of public data. Before a sensible monetization strategy can be laid out, we need to be able to quantify what it costs to operate the platform and maintain the data it serves up. </p>
<p>What are the <span>hard costs that should be considered</span> when operating a public data platform and looking to establish some reasonable monetization objectives?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Acquisition</strong> - What one-time, and recurring costs are associated with acquiring data. This might include ongoing payouts to API contributors who are adding, updating, and validating data via the API.
<ul>
<li><strong>Discover </strong>- What was spent to discover data, and identify its use on platform.</li>
<li><strong>Negotiate</strong> - What time to I have in actually getting access to something.</li>
<li><strong>Licensing </strong>- Are there licensing costs or fees involved with acquisition of data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Development</strong> - What one-time, and recurring costs are associated with platform development.
<ul>
<li><strong>Normalization</strong> - What does it take me to cleanup, and normalize a dataset, or across content. This is usually he busy janitorial work necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Validation</strong> - What is involved with validating that data is accurate correct, providing sources, and following up on references.</li>
<li><strong>Database</strong> - How much work is being put putting into setting up the database, maintaining, backing up, and delivering optimal levels of performance.</li>
<li><strong>Server</strong> - Defining the amount of work put into setting up, and configuring the server(s) to operate an API, including where it goes in the overall operations plan.</li>
<li><strong>Coding</strong> - How much work goes into actually coding an API. Ideally, open source frameworks are employed to reduce overhead, maintenance, and the resources needed to launch new endpoints.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Operational</strong> - What one-time, and recurring costs are associated with platform development.
<ul>
<li><strong>Compute</strong> - What costs are associated with providing server compute capacity to process and deliver public data via APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Storage</strong> -What costs are associated with on the disk storage, for both the database and other images, video, and related objects.</li>
<li><strong>Network</strong> - How much bandwidth in / out is an API using to get the job done, as well as any other network overhead.</li>
<li><strong>Management</strong> - What percentage of API management resources is dedicated to the API. A flat percentage of API management overhead until usage history exists.</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring</strong> - What percentage of the API monitoring, testing, and performance service budget is dedicated to this API. How large is the surface area for monitoring?</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong> - What does it cost to secure a single API, as part of the larger overall operations? Does internal resource spend time, or is this a 3rd party service.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Understand The Value Being Generated By Public Data</strong><br />Now that we understand some of our hard costs, let's have an honest conversation about <span>what value is being generated</span>? First, public data has to offer value, or why are we doing this? Second, nobody is going to pay for anything if it doesn't offer any value. Let's stop for a moment and think about why we are doing all of this in the first place, and what value is worthy of carving off to drive moentization efforts.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Direct Value Generation -</strong> What direct value is being generated by the public data platform operations.
<ul>
<li><strong>Usage</strong> - How is usage wielded as part of value generation? Is value about the increased usage of a resource, or possible value generated by a minimum usage of a resource? Usage is an important dimension of determining how value is generated as part of API operations.</li>
<li><strong>Users</strong> - How is value generated on a per user level? Is more users valuable? or possibly more targeted users? Teams, groups, and many other ways to determine how users impact positively or negatively the value generated from platform usage.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Relationships</strong> - How can relationships between users, or companies be applied to value generated? Will access to more relationships positively or negatively impact how value is generated for platform, and consumers?</li>
<li><strong>Data Acquisition </strong>- Is the acquisition of data part of the generation of value via the public data platform, encouraging the growth of data.</li>
<li><strong>Applications</strong> - Is value generated looked at on a per application basis? Does having multiple applications impact the value generate? Coming up with interesting ways to understand how applications impact platform value for everyone.</li>
<li><strong>Integrations</strong> - What external integrations are available? How can these be leveraged to enhance the value for consumers? Are some integrations part of base operations, where others are accessible at higher levels, or on a one-off basis.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support</strong> - Is access to support something that impacts the value being generated? Does access to support resources introduce the optimal levels of value consumers are looking for? How is support wielded within overall platform monetization.Serv</li>
<li>Service Level Agreements - Are we measuring the number of contracts signed, and partner agreements in place? And how we are delivering against those agreements?</li>
<li><strong>Revenue</strong> - What revenue opportunities for the ecosystem around an API and its operation, sharing in the money made from platform operations. Obviously, anything beyond operating costs should be applied to expansion of efforts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Indirect Value - </strong>What are some of the indirect value being generated by the public data platform operations.
<ul>
<li><strong>Marketing Vehicle</strong> - Having an API is cool these days, and some APIs are worth just having because of the PR value, and discussion.</li>
<li><strong>Traffic Generation</strong> - The API exists solely for distributing links to web and mobile applications, driving traffic to specific properties - is this tracked as part of other analytics?</li>
<li><strong>Brand Awareness</strong> - Applying a brand strategy, and using the API to incentivize publishers to extend the reach of the brand and ultimately the platform - can we quantify this?</li>
<li><strong>Data &amp; Content Acquisition</strong> - Using the API, and the applications built on top as part of a larger data and content acquisition strategy--can we quantify this?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Analysis</strong> - How can analytics be leveraged as part of API value generation? Are analytics part of the base of operations, or are they an added value incentive for consumers, and platform operators.</li>
<li><strong>Competitiveness</strong> - Is the public data effort more agile, flexible, and competitive because it has an API and can deliver on new integrations, partnerships, and to new platforms easier, and more cost effectively?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While there may be other hard costs associated, as well as areas of value being generated, this should provide a simple checklist that any open data provider can use as a beginning blueprint to get going. Additional costs can be included on in these existing areas or added on as new areas as deemed relevant--this is just about getting the monetization conversation going.</p>
<p>There are two objectives in this exercise: 1) understanding the hard costs and value associated with operations 2) assembling into a coherent list so that we can explain to others as part of transparency efforts. When it comes to the business of public data, there is more than just generating revenue, it is about being upfront and honest about why we are doing this, and how it is done--mitigating the political risk involved with doing business with public resources out in the open.</p>
