<p><strong>Enabling and Ensuring Access To Public Data For Everyone Involved</strong><br />Providing access to data is what modern API management infrastructure is all about. Shortly after having a website became normal operating procedure for companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies, web APIs began to emerge to power networks of distributed websites, embeddable widgets, and then mobile applications for many different service providers. APIs can provide access to public data, while modern API management practices ensure that access is balanced and in alignment with platform objectives--resulting in the desired level of control discussed above.</p>
<p>There are a number of areas of access that can be opened up by employing APIs in the service of public data:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Internal</strong> - APIs can be used by all internal efforts, powering websites, mobile applications, and other systems. The awareness, logging, and other benefits can just as easily be applied to internal groups, helping understand how resources are used (or not used) across internal groups.</li>
<li><strong>Partner - </strong>After internal access to data resources, access levels can be crafted to support partner tiers of access, which might include access to special APIs, read and write capabilities, and relaxing of rate limits. These levels often include service level agreements, additional support options, as well as other benefits.</li>
<li><strong>Public</strong> - Data can be made publicly available using the web, while also maintaining the quality and security of the data, keep the access as frictionless as possible, while ensuring things stay up and running, and of expected quality and availability.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy -</strong> Even with publicly available data there is a lot to consider when it comes to the privacy of organizations, locations, and services involved, but also the logging, and tracking associated with platform operations.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency</strong> - One important characteristic of API platform is transparency in the API management layer, being public with the access tiers, resources available, and how a platform operates--without necessary transparency, consumers can become distrustful of the data.</li>
<li><strong>Licensing - </strong>Ideally all data and all schema in this scenario would be licensed as CC0, putting them into the public domain, but if there are license considerations, these requirements can be included along with each API response, as well as in platform documentation.</li>
<li><strong>Platform Meta API -</strong> APIs do not just provide access to the public data, they also provide access to the API management layer for the public data. Modern API management allows for API access to the platform in the several important ways:<br />
<ul>
<li><strong>Users</strong> - Providing API access to user's data and usage.</li>
<li><strong>Apps</strong> - Providing API access to applicaiton level data and usage.</li>
<li><strong>Tiers</strong> - Providing API access to platform tiers and details.</li>
<li><strong>Logs</strong> - Providing API access to the platform log files.</li>
<li><strong>Billing</strong> - Providing API access to the platform billing for access.</li>
<li><strong>Analytics</strong> - Providing API access to the analytics derived from logs, billing, and usage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Observability</strong> - An API management layer on top of public data makes data access observable, allowing platform operators, government agencies, and potentially 3rd party and independent auditors--observability will define both the control as well as access to vital public data resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a world that is increasingly defined by data, access to quality data is important and easy, secure access via the Internet is part of the DNA of public data in this world. API management provides a coherent way to define access to public data, adhering to the mandate that the data is accessible, while also striking a balance to ensure the quality, reliability, and completeness of the public data.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of promises in the past about what open or public data can do by default. In reality opening up data is not a silver bullet, and there is a lot more involved in successfully operating a sustained public data operation. APIs help ensure data resources are made available publicly, while also opening up some new revenue generation opportunities, helping ensure access is sustainable and continues to provide value--hopefully find a balance between public good and any sensible commercial aspirations that may exist.</p>
